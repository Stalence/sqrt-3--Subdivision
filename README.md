# sqrt-3--Subdivision

Accepts an obj file of a 3d object and smoothes it with the sqrt(3) subdivision method. 
Note: Objects with holes will likely have artifacts after smoothing. Some example objects
are supplied, you can use the "teddy.obj" that comes along with the code.
More iterations leads to smoother(but also slower) results and higher polygon count.
